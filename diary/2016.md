I went to Koh Rong Island for vacation of Labor Day with my colleagues few days ago.

We set off at early morning to avoid traffic jam, oh, the driver we hired was the same guy, whom we hired for last vacation to Siem Reap, all of us were sleepy cause woke up earlier than usual, and it's boring on the way to Sihanoukville, so sometimes we slept, talked with each other and made some jokes, also tasted some snacks.

It's almost noon when we got to there, so we went to the restaurant

Today afternoon I went to nearby gym, I haven't been there for some time, because of the Khmer new year, that gym closed at that time, and heartsick, I had a cold, so I'm so tired recently.

why I determined to swimming? casuse I thought always sleep is not good way to getting better, other reason is because even I sleep a lot but sitll look and feel weak, so I can't use my phone or computer for too long.

So I went to gym with my two colleagues, then putted on my swimsuit in men locker room and walked to pool. 
Luckly, the water feel warm, and other part which the sun is shining on was little hot.

The pool look empty, cause there are just three people before I arrived, I like that, I always enjoy in peacful.

And better is one of those people in pool is a sexy girl with bikini, yeah, She look pretty hot and cool, But she seems injured cause I saw her hand in plaster which made me feel curious, I have to say what a brave girl although injured sitll came to swimming.

Actually, When I jumped into the pool, The girl went out from the pool later, and lie on the chair palyed with her phone.

来到柬埔寨，突然意识到英语的重要性，以前在国内，总觉得这辈子自己应该没什么机会用上英语的了，反正查单词读api，勉勉强强理解就可以了。

可没想到，竟然要用上，还要交流，也就迫切的需要提高自己的英语水平了，而从新拾起，才发现自己已然忘记了那么多，又或者是自己根本没有学到什么。

说不出口，听也听不了多少，单词量惨淡。

所以这几个月都在网上疯狂寻找学英语的方法资料，在kindle粗略看了那本「把你的英语用起来！」，知道了一些技巧，死记硬背单词没用，需要疯狂输入听力和阅读，所以开始在amazon找原著小说读，下载了几本如「The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes」，「Les Miserables」，「How to speak and write correctly」等。发现没一本看得下去，生词都好多，都看了几页还是不知道具体在讲什么，这样会生厌，就没有进行下去了。最后发现「Grimm's Fairy Tales」的词汇量适合我。。。

同时还在`Medium`和`Quora`上阅读英文文章，读懂的同时，留意句子的构造以及生词。

听力的话，发现了个很棒的地方，`iPhone`有个`app`叫`podcast`，里面有很多学习英语的广播，现在主要在听`ELSPOD`，语速很合适，解释得也很好。

vocabulary，这个刚刚发现，也试下。在`Quora`上`follow`了Learning English的话题，估计可以慢慢发现更多好的学习方法。
