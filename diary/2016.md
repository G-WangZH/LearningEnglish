Today afternoon I went to nearby gym, I haven't been there for some time, because of the Khmer new year, that gym closed at that time, and heartsick, I had a cold, so I'm so tired recently.

why I determined to swimming? casuse I thought always sleep is not good way to getting better, other reason is because even I sleep a lot but sitll look and feel weak, so I can't use my phone or computer for too long.

So I went to gym with my two colleagues, then putted on my swimsuit in men locker room and walked to pool. 
Luckly, the water feel warm, and other part which the sun is shining on was little hot.

The pool look empty, cause there are just three people before I arrived, I like that, I always enjoy in peacful.

And better is one of those people in pool is a sexy girl with bikini, yeah, She look pretty hot and cool, But she seems injured cause I saw her hand in plaster which made me feel curious, I have to say what a brave girl although injured sitll came to swimming.

Actually, When I jumped into the pool, The girl went out from the pool later, and lie on the chair palyed with her phone.
